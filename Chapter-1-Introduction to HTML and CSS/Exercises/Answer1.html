    <!-- Method on how to bake/cook in ordered list -->
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Thoroughly butter six 6-ounce ramekins and dust with cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, melt the dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and 50g of white chocolate together with the butter, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs, egg yolks, and sugar with an electric mixer until pale and thick (about 4 minutes).</li>
        <li>Fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture until well combined.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and salt over the chocolate mixture and gently fold until just incorporated. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Fill each ramekin halfway with the batter. Place 2-3 chunks of white chocolate in the center of each, then cover with the remaining batter until the ramekins are about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 12-14 minutes until the edges are firm but the centers are still soft.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 1 minute. Run a knife around the edges to loosen, then carefully invert each cake onto a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately, while the centers are still warm and molten.</li>
        <li>Optional: Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or fresh berries for an extra touch of indulgence.</li>
    </ol>
